CHANGELOG
---------

### 0.4.0

#### Added
 * Node security group ID as output of the `kops-cluster` module
 * Helper module to provision EBS volumes as kubernetes persistent volumes
   (includes the ability to restore them from a snapshot)
 * Possibility to configure an OIDC provider to the Kubernetes API (tested with
   Google and Github)

#### Changed
 * We're not creating an S3 VPC endpoint automatically, however you can create
   it outside of the `kops-cluster` module using the exported `vpc-id`.

### 0.3.0 - RBAC !

#### Added
 * It is now possible to create `kops` clusters with RBAC enabled by default
 * etcd volumes are encrypted
 * support for kops ability to disable the automatic creation of security groups
   when creating a LoadBalancer service

#### Fixed
 * During `terraform destroy`, avoid errors that occur in case the cluster has
   already been deleted outside of Terraform
 * Kops cluster domain and your cluster's kube-dns domain are now setup
   accordingly

### 0.2.0 - Add relevant variables and outputs to our kops modules

#### Fixed
 * premature Internet Gateway destroy triggering Terraform errors on destroyed
   (could be worked around by running destroy twice)

#### Added
 * the ASG generated by kops with the `kops-ig` module now have their names
   exposed as outputs (so that you can - for instance - expose your ingress
   controllers as a NodePort on the host and wire them to an ELB)
 * Terraform variable to attach custom security groups to an instance group
   (for the same purpose essentially)
 * kops-created subnets now have their subnet ids exposed as outputs (so that
   you can use Terraform to create resources in these same subnets)

### 0.1.0 - First release of Karch

A Terraform module designed as a wrapper around kops, it makes it possible to
spawn kops clusters using the `kops-cluster` and `kops-ip` modules, supports
cluster updates and deletes and exposes resources created by kops to the rest of
your Terraform code, as simple Terraform outputs.
